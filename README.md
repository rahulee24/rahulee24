# Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub Profile

## About Me

Hello! I'm an enthusiastic learner passionate about **Electrical Engineering**, **Web Development**, and **Machine Learning**. I love exploring the intersection of hardware and software, building innovative web applications, and developing intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

### 🔌 Electrical Engineering
I'm fascinated by the world of circuits, power systems, and embedded systems. There's something incredibly satisfying about designing systems that interact with the physical world. From microcontrollers to signal processing, I enjoy understanding how electrical components work together to create functional devices.

### 💻 Web Development
Creating intuitive and responsive web applications is where creativity meets functionality. I love the entire web development stack - from crafting beautiful user interfaces to building robust backend systems. The ability to bring ideas to life through code and make them accessible to users worldwide is what drives my passion in this field.

### 🤖 Machine Learning
The potential of machine learning to transform data into actionable insights amazes me. I'm constantly learning about neural networks, computer vision, natural language processing, and how AI can be applied to solve complex problems. The challenge of teaching machines to learn and make decisions is both intellectually stimulating and incredibly rewarding.
